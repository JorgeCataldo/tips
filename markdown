Harvard, Minerva, and the tech school '42' are some examples of successful initiatives of using PBL to develop **professional higher skills**. The strength of adopting the PBL strategy in vocational education lies in the **pragmatism** of their learning experiences, which helps **accelerate students' employability gains** in the labor market. <br><br>

**Why using OPEN-PBL APP**  <br>
Despite the advantages of adopting PBL-based educational architectures, only few schools fully embrace the PBL approach because it requires more expensive academic resources as they are often scarce and poorly scalable. The OPEN-PBL APP helps schools and businesses address these constraints by providing a set of features for managing the execution of **class trails to discuss problem-cases solving**, such as  business and medical case study classes, sessions for discussion of tech projects solutions and more. To ensure the integrity of the application of PBL tutorial process, OPENPBL APP:
- Interacts with teachers to help them create and disseminate case-problems (CP), and evaluate student performance in CP discussion classes.
- Interacts with students to help them research and learn the academic skills required for CP analysis, and prepare the individual arguments for CP discussion. <br><br>

OPEN-PBL APPâ€™s set of features enables schools and businesses to embrace the PBL strategy in their architecture and educational systems without the need of acquiring expensive and non scalable academic resources. Thus, they can ensure the proper application and measurement of the effectiveness of educational architectures to:
- Deploy **fully student-centered educational systems** by embracing the use of PBL; or
- Just **add some PBL experiences** to the education systems they currently use. <br>
